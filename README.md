We establish a lizard inspired quadrupedal robot which is able to walk on flat surfaces and climb on inclined or horizontal textured walls. 

Key features 
- **Measure stride distance**
- **Measure time per stride**
- **Measure current consumption**
- **Accelerometer data**
- **Adjustable gait parameters: ROM, Wrist angles etc.**
- **Interchangeable leg length**
